 <!-- html elements  An	HTML	element	is	
        everything	between	the	start	tag	and	the	end	tag 
		Don’t Forget the end tag 
		<br>	is	an	empty	element	without	a	closing	tag.
		It	defines	a	line	break 
			writing	<br/>	is better than <br> 
			Use Lowercase tags , html tags are not case sensitive -->
